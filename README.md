INA219 High Side DC Current Sensor Breakout Board - Custom Design
 <!-- Replace with your actual image URL -->

Description
This repository contains the custom design files for a modified INA219 High Side DC Current Sensor Breakout Board. The design is fully compatible with the Adafruit INA219 module but incorporates several key improvements to enhance performance and reliability.

Key Improvements
Redesigned Layout: The PCB layout has been completely redesigned, maintaining the same form factor and mounting hole placements as the original Adafruit module.
EMI Shielding: Integrated electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding for improved signal integrity in noisy environments.
4-Wire Kelvin Connection: Correct 4-wire Kelvin connection for more accurate current sensing, minimizing the impact of trace resistance.
Matched Area for Vin- and Vin+: Ensures balanced signal paths for Vin- and Vin+, improving measurement accuracy.
Decoupling Capacitor: A decoupling capacitor has been added across the amplifier input pins to reduce noise and improve stability.
Configurable I2C Address: I2C address pins (A0 and A1) can be jumper soldered to either ground or VCC, allowing for flexible address configuration.
